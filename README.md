# speak to me
When I discovered Artyom,js (a fantastic wrapper of the speechSynthesis and webkitSpeechRecognition APIs) I couldn't not do something with it. So I created this little app. Upon user's vocal commands it enquiries the Wikipedia API and when something is found it read the answer.

Please note: at the moment this works only with Google Chrome.

commands: "speak to me about..." or "what about..." or "tell me about..." 

(e.g. "tell me about Jimi Hendrix")
