# speak to me
When I discovered Artyom.js (a fantastic wrapper of the speechSynthesis and webkitSpeechRecognition APIs) I couldn't not do something with it. Upon user's vocal commands, this app inquiries the Wikipedia API and when something is found it reads the answer.

This is just a starting point, as this app can be improved as far as the imagination can go. Moreover, the Wikipedia API is quite fussy so not always a result is found.

Please note: at the moment this works only on Google Chrome.

commands: "speak to me about..." or "what about..." or "tell me about..." 

(e.g. "tell me about Jimi Hendrix")
